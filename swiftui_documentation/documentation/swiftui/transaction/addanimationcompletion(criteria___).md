```swift
mutating func addAnimationCompletion(criteria: AnimationCompletionCriteria = .logicallyComplete, _ completion: @escaping () -> Void)
```

## Discussion

The completion callback will always be fired exactly one time. If no animations are created by the changes in `body`, then the callback will be called immediately after `body`.

## Managing animations
