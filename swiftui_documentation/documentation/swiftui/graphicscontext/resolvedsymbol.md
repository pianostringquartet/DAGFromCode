## Overview

You resolve a child view in preparation for drawing it into a context by calling [resolveSymbol(id:)](/documentation/swiftui/graphicscontext/resolvesymbol(id:)). The resolved view takes into account environment values like the display resolution and current color scheme.

## Getting the symbol properties

- [size](/documentation/swiftui/graphicscontext/resolvedsymbol/size) The dimensions of the resolved symbol.

## Resolving a drawn entity

- [resolve(_:)](/documentation/swiftui/graphicscontext/resolve(_:))
- [resolveSymbol(id:)](/documentation/swiftui/graphicscontext/resolvesymbol(id:))
- [GraphicsContext.ResolvedImage](/documentation/swiftui/graphicscontext/resolvedimage)
- [GraphicsContext.ResolvedText](/documentation/swiftui/graphicscontext/resolvedtext)
