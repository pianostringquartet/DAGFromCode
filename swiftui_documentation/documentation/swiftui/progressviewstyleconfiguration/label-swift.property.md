> A view that describes the task represented by the progress view.

```swift
var label: ProgressViewStyleConfiguration.Label?
```

## Discussion

If `nil`, then the task is self-evident from the surrounding context, and the style does not need to provide any additional description.

If the progress view is defined using a `Progress` instance, then this label is equivalent to its `localizedDescription`.

## Configuring the label
