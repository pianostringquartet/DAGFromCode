> An opaque collection representing the sections of view.

```swift
struct SectionCollection
```

## Overview

Sections are constructed lazily, on demand, so access only as much of this collection as is necessary to create the resulting content.

You can get access to a viewâ€™s [Section Collection](/documentation/swiftui/sectioncollection) by using the `Group/init(sectionsOf:transform:)` initializer.

Any content of the given view which is not explicitly specified as a section is grouped with its sibling content to form implicit sections, meaning the minimum number of sections in a `SectionCollection` is one.
