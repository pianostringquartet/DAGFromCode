## Overview

When a view is appearing with a transition, the transition will first be shown with the `willAppear` phase, then will be immediately moved to the `identity` phase. When a view is being removed, its transition is changed from the `identity` phase to the `didDisappear` phase. If a view is removed while it is still transitioning in, then its phase will change to `didDisappear`. If a view is re-added while it is transitioning out, its phase will change back to `identity`.

In the `identity` phase, transitions should generally not make any visual change to the view they are applied to, since the transition’s view modifications in the `identity` phase will be applied to the view as long as it is visible. In the `willAppear` and `didDisappear` phases, transitions should apply a change that will be animated to create the transition. If no animatable change is applied, then the transition will be a no-op.

## Getting the phase

- [TransitionPhase.identity](/documentation/swiftui/transitionphase/identity) The transition is being applied to a view that is in the view hierarchy.
- [TransitionPhase.willAppear](/documentation/swiftui/transitionphase/willappear) The transition is being applied to a view that is about to be inserted into the view hierarchy.
- [TransitionPhase.didDisappear](/documentation/swiftui/transitionphase/diddisappear) The transition is being applied to a view that has been requested to be removed from the view hierarchy.

## Getting phase characteristics

- [isIdentity](/documentation/swiftui/transitionphase/isidentity) A Boolean that indicates whether the transition should have an identity effect, i.e. not change the appearance of its view.
- [value](/documentation/swiftui/transitionphase/value) A value that can be used to multiply effects that are applied differently depending on the phase.
