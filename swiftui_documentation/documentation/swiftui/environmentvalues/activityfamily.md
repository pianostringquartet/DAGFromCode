## Discussion

A Live Activity you initiate on one device can also appear on a remote device that renders the Live Activity in a different family size. As a result, it renders for a specific family, depending on both the device and the location in which it appears. For example, when rendering on the iOS or iPadOS Lock Screen, the current family is doc://com.apple.comdumentation/documentation/WidgetKit/ActivityFamily/medium.

Use [supplementalActivityFamilies(_:)](/documentation/SwiftUI/WidgetConfiguration/supplementalActivityFamilies(_:)) to opt in and allow your Live Activity to render with additional families.

## Configuring a Live Activity
