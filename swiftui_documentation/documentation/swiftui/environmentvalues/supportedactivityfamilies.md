## Discussion

To detect the currently rendered activity family size, use the [activity Family](/documentation/SwiftUI/EnvironmentValues/activityFamily) environment variable. The `supportedActivityFamilies` environment value might only be useful if your make you make your Live Activity views available in a Swift package.
