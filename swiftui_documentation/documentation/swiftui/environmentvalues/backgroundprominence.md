## Discussion

Foreground elements above an increased prominence background are typically adjusted to have higher contrast against a potentially vivid color, such as taking on a higher opacity monochrome appearance according to the `colorScheme`. System styles like `primary`, `secondary`, etc will automatically resolve to an appropriate style in this context. The property can be read and used for custom styled elements.

In the example below, a custom star rating element is in a list row alongside some text. When the row is selected and has an increased prominence appearance, the text and star rating will update their appearance, the star rating replacing its use of yellow with the standard `secondary` style.

```swift
struct RecipeList: View {
    var recipes: [Recipe]
    @Binding var selectedRecipe: Recipe.ID?

    var body: some View {
        List(recipes, selection: $selectedRecipe) {
            RecipeListRow(recipe: $0)
        }
    }
}

struct RecipeListRow: View {
    var recipe: Recipe
    var body: some View {
        VStack(alignment: .leading) {
            HStack(alignment: .firstTextBaseline) {
                Text(recipe.name)
                Spacer()
                StarRating(rating: recipe.rating)
            }
            Text(recipe.description)
                .foregroundStyle(.secondary)
                .lineLimit(2, reservesSpace: true)
        }
    }
}

private struct StarRating: View {
    var rating: Int

    @Environment(\.backgroundProminence)
    private var backgroundProminence

    var body: some View {
        HStack(spacing: 1) {
            ForEach(0..<rating, id: \.self) { _ in
                Image(systemName: "star.fill")
            }
        }
        .foregroundStyle(backgroundProminence == .increased ?
            AnyShapeStyle(.secondary) : AnyShapeStyle(.yellow))
        .imageScale(.small)
    }
}
```

Note that the use of `backgroundProminence` was used by a view that was nested in additional stack containers within the row. This ensured that the value correctly reflected the environment within the list row itself, as opposed to the environment of the list as a whole. One way to ensure correct resolution would be to prefer using this in a custom ShapeStyle instead, for example:

```swift
private struct StarRating: View {
    var rating: Int

    var body: some View {
        HStack(spacing: 1) {
            ForEach(0..<rating, id: \.self) { _ in
                Image(systemName: "star.fill")
            }
        }
        .foregroundStyle(FillStyle())
        .imageScale(.small)
    }
}

extension StarRating {
    struct FillStyle: ShapeStyle {
        func resolve(in env: EnvironmentValues) -> some ShapeStyle {
            switch env.backgroundProminence {
            case .increased: return AnyShapeStyle(.secondary)
            default: return AnyShapeStyle(.yellow)
            }
        }
    }
}
```

Views like `List` and `Table` as well as standard shape styles like `ShapeStyle.selection` will automatically update the background prominence of foreground views. For custom backgrounds, this environment property can be explicitly set on views above custom backgrounds.
