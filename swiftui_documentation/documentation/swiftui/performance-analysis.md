# Performance analysis

> Measure and improve your app’s responsiveness.

## Overview

Use Instruments to detect hangs and hitches in your app, and to analyze long view body updates and frequently occurring SwiftUI updates that can contribute to hangs and hitches.

## Essentials

- [Understanding user interface responsiveness](/documentation/Xcode/understanding-user-interface-responsiveness) Make your app more responsive by examining the event-handling and rendering loop.
- [Understanding hangs in your app](/documentation/Xcode/understanding-hangs-in-your-app) Determine the cause for delays in user interactions by examining the main thread and the main run loop.
- [Understanding hitches in your app](/documentation/Xcode/understanding-hitches-in-your-app) Determine the cause of interruptions in motion by examining the render loop.

## Analyzing SwiftUI performance

- [Understanding and improving SwiftUI performance](/documentation/Xcode/understanding-and-improving-swiftui-performance) Identify and address long-running view updates, and reduce the frequency of updates.

## Tool support

- [Previews in Xcode](/documentation/swiftui/previews-in-xcode)
- [Xcode library customization](/documentation/swiftui/xcode-library-customization)
