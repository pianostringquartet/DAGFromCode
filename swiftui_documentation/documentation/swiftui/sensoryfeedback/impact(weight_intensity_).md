```swift
static func impact(weight: SensoryFeedback.Weight = .medium, intensity: Double = 1.0) -> SensoryFeedback
```

## Discussion

Use this to provide feedback for UI elements colliding. It should supplement the user experience, since only some platforms will play feedback in response to it.

Not all platforms will play different feedback for different weights and intensities of impact.

Only plays feedback on iOS and watchOS.
