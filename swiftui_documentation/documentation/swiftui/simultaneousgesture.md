## Overview

A simultaneous gesture is a container-event handler that evaluates its two child gestures at the same time. Its value is a struct with two optional values, each representing the phases of one of the two gestures.

## Conforms To

## Creating the gesture

- [init(_:_:)](/documentation/swiftui/simultaneousgesture/init(_:_:)) Creates a gesture with two gestures that can receive updates or succeed independently of each other.
- [first](/documentation/swiftui/simultaneousgesture/first) The first of two gestures that can happen simultaneously.
- [second](/documentation/swiftui/simultaneousgesture/second) The second of two gestures that can happen simultaneously.

## Getting the gestureâ€™s values

- [SimultaneousGesture.Value](/documentation/swiftui/simultaneousgesture/value) The value of a simultaneous gesture that indicates which of its two gestures receives events.
