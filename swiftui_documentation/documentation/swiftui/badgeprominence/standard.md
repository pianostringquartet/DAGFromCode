> The standard level of prominence for a badge.

```swift
static let standard: BadgeProminence
```

## Discussion

This level of prominence should be used for badges that display a value that suggests user action, such as a count of unread messages or new invitations.

In lists on macOS, this results in a badge label on a grayscale platter; and in lists on iOS, this prominence of badge has no platter.

```swift
List(mailboxes) { mailbox in
    Text(mailbox.name)
        .badge(mailbox.numberOfUnreadMessages)
}
.badgeProminence(.standard)
```
