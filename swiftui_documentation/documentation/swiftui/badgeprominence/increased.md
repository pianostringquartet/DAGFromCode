> The highest level of prominence for a badge.

```swift
static let increased: BadgeProminence
```

## Discussion

This level of prominence should be used for badges that display a value that requires user action, such as number of updates or account errors.

In lists on iOS and macOS, this results in badge labels being displayed on a red platter.

```swift
ForEach(accounts) { account in
    Text(account.userName)
        .badge(account.setupErrors)
        .badgeProminence(.increased)
}
```
