> Creates an  using a WatchKit Application Delegate.

```swift
@MainActor @preconcurrency init(_ delegateType: DelegateType.Type = DelegateType.self)
```

## Discussion

The framework will initialize the provided delegate and manage its lifetime, calling out to it when appropriate after performing its own work.

> [!NOTE]
> The instantiated delegate will be placed in the Environment and may be accessed by using the `@Environment` property wrapper in the view hierarchy.
