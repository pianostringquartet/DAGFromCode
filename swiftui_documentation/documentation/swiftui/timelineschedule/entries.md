## Discussion

The [entries(from:mode:)](/documentation/swiftui/timelineschedule/entries(from:mode:)) method returns a value of this type, which is a [Sequence](/documentation/Swift/Sequence) of dates in ascending order. A [Timeline View](/documentation/swiftui/timelineview) that you create with a schedule updates its content at the moments in time corresponding to the dates included in the sequence.

## Getting a sequence of dates

- [entries(from:mode:)](/documentation/swiftui/timelineschedule/entries(from:mode:))
