## Discussion

When a [Text](/documentation/swiftui/text) provides different size options for its content, the size dependent preference chooses the largest option that fits into the available space without truncating or clipping its content.

> [!NOTE]
> Only use this option where needed as it incurs a performance cost on every [Text](/documentation/swiftui/text) it is applied to, even if the concrete text initializer cannot provide multiple size variants and there is no visual impact.

## Difference to ViewThatFits

The [size Dependent](/documentation/swiftui/textvariantpreference/sizedependent) text variant preference differs from [View That Fits](/documentation/swiftui/viewthatfits) both in usage and in behavior. [View That Fits](/documentation/swiftui/viewthatfits) chooses the first child where the **ideal** size fits the available space. For [Text](/documentation/swiftui/text) this means that it will only choose texts that can fit their contents into the available space **without a line break**. With this text variant preference, on the other hand, the largest variant is chosen that can fit the available space while respecting all the regular layout rules, such as [line Limit](/documentation/swiftui/environmentvalues/linelimit).

To use [View That Fits](/documentation/swiftui/viewthatfits), multiple different views have to be provided as the different size options. With this text variant preference, a single [Text](/documentation/swiftui/text) provides the different size variants intrinsically. The way it generates these size variants and how many size variants are available depends on the text initializer used.
