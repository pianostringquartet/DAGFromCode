**Instance Method**

# accessibilityDragPoint(_:description:isEnabled:)

**Available on:** iOS 18.0+, iPadOS 18.0+, Mac Catalyst 18.0+, macOS 15.0+, visionOS 2.0+

> The point an assistive technology should use to begin a drag interaction.

```swift
nonisolated func accessibilityDragPoint(_ point: UnitPoint, description: LocalizedStringKey, isEnabled: Bool) -> ModifiedContent<Content, Modifier>
```

## Parameters

**point**

The point the assistive technology will begin a drag interaction.



**description**

The description of the drag interaction.



**isEnabled**

If true the accessibility drag point is applied; otherwise the accessibility drag point is unchanged.



## Discussion

Use this modifier when you need to provide a description to users when prompted begin a drag interaction.

```swift
struct FileView: View {
    var filename: String

    var body: some View {
        FileIcon(filename: filename)
            .accessibilityDragPoint(
                .center, description: Text("Move \(filename)"))
    }
}
```

By default, if an accessible view or its subtree has drag and/or drop interactions, they will be automatically exposed by assistive technologies. However, if there is more than one such interaction, each drag or drop should have a description to disambiguate it and give a good user experience.

> [!NOTE]
> An accessibility element can have multiple points for a drag, provided they have different descriptions.
