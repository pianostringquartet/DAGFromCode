> The point an assistive technology should use to begin a drag interaction.

```swift
nonisolated func accessibilityDragPoint(_ point: UnitPoint, description: LocalizedStringKey) -> ModifiedContent<Content, Modifier>
```

## Discussion

Use this modifier when you need to provide a description to users when prompted begin a drag interaction.

```swift
struct FileView: View {
    var filename: String

    var body: some View {
        FileIcon(filename: filename)
            .accessibilityDragPoint(.center, description: "Move \(filename)")
    }
}
```

By default, if an accessible view or its subtree has drag and/or drop interactions, they will be automatically exposed by assistive technologies. However, if there is more than one such interaction, each drag or drop should have a description to disambiguate it and give a good user experience.

> [!NOTE]
> An accessibility element can have multiple points for a drag, provided they have different descriptions.
