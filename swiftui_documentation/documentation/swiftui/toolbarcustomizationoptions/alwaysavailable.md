## Discussion

In iOS, default customizable toolbar content have the option of always being available in the toolbar regardless of the customization status of the user. These items will always be in the overflow menu of the toolbar. Users can customize whether the items are present as controls in the toolbar itself but will still always be able to access the item if they remove it from the toolbar itself.

Consider using this for items that users should always be able to access, but may not be important enough to always occupy space in the toolbar itself.
