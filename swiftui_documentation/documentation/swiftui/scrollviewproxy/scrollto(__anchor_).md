> Scans all scroll views contained by the proxy for the first with a child view with identifier , and then scrolls to that view.

```swift
func scrollTo<ID>(_ id: ID, anchor: UnitPoint? = nil) where ID : Hashable
```

## Parameters

**id**

The identifier of a child view to scroll to.



**anchor**

The alignment behavior of the scroll action.



## Discussion

If `anchor` is `nil`, this method finds the container of the identified view, and scrolls the minimum amount to make the identified view wholly visible.

If `anchor` is non-`nil`, it defines the points in the identified view and the scroll view to align. For example, setting `anchor` to [top](/documentation/swiftui/unitpoint/top) aligns the top of the identified view to the top of the scroll view. Similarly, setting `anchor` to [bottom](/documentation/swiftui/unitpoint/bottom) aligns the bottom of the identified view to the bottom of the scroll view, and so on.
