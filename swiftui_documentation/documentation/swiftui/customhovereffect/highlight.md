## Discussion

For pointer input this effect morphs the pointer into a platter behind the view and shows a light source indicating position.

On tvOS it applies a projection effect accompanied with a specular highlight on the view when contained within a focused view. It also incorporates motion effects to produce a parallax effect by adjusting the projection matrix and specular offset.

On visionOS this effect applies a glow effect based on where the user is looking or touching the view.
