```swift
var wrappedValue: Value { get nonmutating set }

## Discussion

When focus is not in any view that is bound to this state, the wrapped value will be `nil` (for optional-typed state) or `false` (for `Bool`- typed state).

## Getting the state

- [projectedValue](/documentation/swiftui/accessibilityfocusstate/projectedvalue)
