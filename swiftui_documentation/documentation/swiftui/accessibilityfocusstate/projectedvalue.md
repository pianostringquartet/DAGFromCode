## Discussion

Use `projectedValue` in conjunction with [accessibilityFocused(_:equals:)](/documentation/swiftui/view/accessibilityfocused(_:equals:)) to establish bindings between view content and accessibility focus placement.

## Getting the state

- [wrappedValue](/documentation/swiftui/accessibilityfocusstate/wrappedvalue)
- [AccessibilityFocusState.Binding](/documentation/swiftui/accessibilityfocusstate/binding)
