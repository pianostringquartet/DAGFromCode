**Sample Code**

# Building rich SwiftUI text experiences

**Available on:** iOS 26.0+, iPadOS 26.0+, Xcode 26.0+

> Build an editor for formatted text using SwiftUI text editor views and attributed strings.

## Overview

> [!NOTE]
> This sample code project is associated with WWDC25 session 280: [](https://developer.apple.com/wwdc25/280/).

You can follow along with the code written in the WWDC25 session, learning how to upgrade `TextEditor` to rich text, build custom controls, and constrain the formatting options the editor provides.

After the code-along, you can learn more about how to persist rich text using SwiftData, and how to export rich text documents using the `Transferable` protocol.

### Configure the sample code project

To configure the sample code project, do the following in Xcode:

1. Open the sample with the latest version of Xcode.
2. Set the developer team to let Xcode automatically manage the provisioning profile. For more information, see [preparing-your-app-for-distribution#Set-the-bundle](/documentation/Xcode/preparing-your-app-for-distribution) and [preparing-your-app-for-distribution#Assign-the-project-to-a](/documentation/Xcode/preparing-your-app-for-distribution).

## Getting text input
