```swift
var containerCornerInsets: RectangleCornerInsets { get }
```

## Discussion

```swift
GeometryReader { geometry in
    NavigationTitleView()
        .offset(x: geometry.containerCornerInsets.topLeading.width)
}
```

Container corner inset sizes may not be uniform. For example, on iPadOS and macOS, when the window fills the entire screen without displaying window controls, the inset sizes will always be zero. When that window does display window controls, and the view overlaps the window control area, the corner inset size for the top leading corner will be the size of the overlapping area.
