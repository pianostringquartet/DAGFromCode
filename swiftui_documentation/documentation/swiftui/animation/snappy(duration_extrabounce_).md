```swift
static func snappy(duration: TimeInterval = 0.5, extraBounce: Double = 0.0) -> Animation

## Parameters

**duration**

The perceptual duration, which defines the pace of the spring. This is approximately equal to the settling duration, but for very bouncy springs, will be the duration of the period of oscillation for the spring.



**extraBounce**

How much additional bounce should be added to the base bounce of 0.15.
