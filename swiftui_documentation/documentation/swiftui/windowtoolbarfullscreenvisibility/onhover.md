**Type Property**

# onHover

**Available on:** macOS 15.0+

> Hide the window toolbar in full screen mode by default. It will reveal itself when the mouse moves into the area occupied by the menu bar.

```swift
static let onHover: WindowToolbarFullScreenVisibility
```

## Discussion

This has no effect if the toolbar is completely hidden, i.e. setting the visibility to `hidden` for `windowToolbar` placements using [toolbarVisibility(_:for:)](/documentation/swiftui/view/toolbarvisibility(_:for:)) will cause the toolbar to remain completely hidden, even in full screen.
