## Discussion

This point occupies the position where the horizontal and vertical alignment guides intersect for [bottom Trailing](/documentation/swiftui/alignment/bottomtrailing) alignment. The trailing edge appears on the right in a left-to-right language environment and on the left in a right-to-left environment.
