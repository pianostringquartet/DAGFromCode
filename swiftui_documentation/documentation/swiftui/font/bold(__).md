## Discussion

For fonts created from text styles, passing `true` could mean applying emphasized styling, which does not necessarily mean the bold weight specifically, so this modifier is not to be confused with [weight(_:)](/documentation/SwiftUI/Font/weight(_:)).

For example:

```swift
Font.body.bold(true)
```

will most likely get you the emphasized version of body text style, which is often in [semibold](/documentation/SwiftUI/Font/Weight/semibold) weight. While

```swift
Font.body.weight(.bold)
```

will specifically get you the body text style font in the [bold](/documentation/SwiftUI/Font/Weight/bold) weight.

Using:

```swift
Font.body.bold(false)
```

will remove any emphasized styling from the font returning to its default weight which is most likely but not guaranteed to be 0.0 or [regular](/documentation/swiftui/font/weight/regular).
