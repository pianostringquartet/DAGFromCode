**Type Method**

# image(_:hotSpot:)

**Available on:** macOS 15.0+

> Initializes a pointer style with a given image and hot spot.

```swift
static func image(_ image: Image, hotSpot: UnitPoint) -> PointerStyle
```

## Parameters

**image**

The pointer image.



**hotSpot**

The point on the image that represents the location from which the pointer interaction occurs. For example, the hot spot of an arrow-shaped pointer is the tip of the arrow.



## Discussion

The hot spot is the part of the pointer that must be positioned over an onscreen element for clicking to have an effect.

For guidance on using a custom pointer, refer to [pointing](/design/Human-Interface-Guidelines/pointing-devices) in the Human Interface Guidelines.

You may apply this pointer style to a single view or a view hierarchy using the [pointerStyle(_:)](/documentation/swiftui/view/pointerstyle(_:)) modifier.
