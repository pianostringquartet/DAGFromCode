```swift
struct LazyHStack<Content> where Content : View
```

## Overview

The stack is “lazy,” in that the stack view doesn’t create items until it needs to render them onscreen.

In the following example, a [Scroll View](/documentation/swiftui/scrollview) contains a `LazyHStack` that consists of a horizontal row of text views. The stack aligns to the top of the scroll view and uses 10-point spacing between each text view.

```swift
ScrollView(.horizontal) {
    LazyHStack(alignment: .top, spacing: 10) {
        ForEach(1...100, id: \.self) {
            Text("Column \($0)")
        }
    }
}
```

## Conforms To

- [View](/documentation/swiftui/view)

## Creating a lazy-loading horizontal stack

- [init(alignment:spacing:pinnedViews:content:)](/documentation/swiftui/lazyhstack/init(alignment:spacing:pinnedviews:content:)) Creates a lazy horizontal stack view with the given spacing, vertical alignment, pinning behavior, and content.

## Dynamically arranging views in one dimension

- [Grouping data with lazy stack views](/documentation/swiftui/grouping-data-with-lazy-stack-views)
- [Creating performant scrollable stacks](/documentation/swiftui/creating-performant-scrollable-stacks)
- [LazyVStack](/documentation/swiftui/lazyvstack)
- [PinnedScrollableViews](/documentation/swiftui/pinnedscrollableviews)
