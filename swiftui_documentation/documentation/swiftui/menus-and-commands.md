# Menus and commands

> Provide space-efficient, context-dependent access to commands and controls.

## Overview

Use a menu to provide people with easy access to common commands. You can add items to a macOS or iPadOS appâ€™s menu bar using the [commands(content:)](/documentation/swiftui/scene/commands(content:)) scene modifier, or create context menus that people reveal near their current task using the [contextMenu(menuItems:)](/documentation/swiftui/view/contextmenu(menuitems:)) view modifier.



Create submenus by nesting [Menu](/documentation/swiftui/menu) instances inside others. Use a [Divider](/documentation/swiftui/divider) view to create a separator between menu elements.

For design guidance, see [menus](/design/Human-Interface-Guidelines/menus) in the Human Interface Guidelines.
