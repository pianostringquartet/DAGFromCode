## Discussion

Examples of automatic behavior on macOS:

- Materials used as a `window` container background will appear inactive when the containing window is inactive.
- `Material.bar` materials will appear inactive when the containing window is inactive.
- All other materials will appear as active.

Materials always appear as active on all other platforms.
