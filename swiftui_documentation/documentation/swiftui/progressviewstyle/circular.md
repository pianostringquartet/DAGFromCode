```swift
@MainActor @preconcurrency static var circular: CircularProgressViewStyle { get }
```

## Discussion

On watchOS, and in widgets and complications, a circular progress view appears as a gauge with the [accessory Circular Capacity](/documentation/swiftui/gaugestyle/accessorycircularcapacity) style. If the progress view is indeterminate, the gauge is empty.

In cases where no determinate circular progress view style is available, circular progress views use an indeterminate style.
