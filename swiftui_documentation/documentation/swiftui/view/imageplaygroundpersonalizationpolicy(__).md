nonisolated func imagePlaygroundPersonalizationPolicy(_ policy: ImagePlaygroundPersonalizationPolicy = .automatic) -> some View
```

## Parameters

**policy**

Policy determining whether personalization is enabled or not.



## Return Value

An image playground sheet that does or does not support personalization, based on the `enabled` flag.

## Discussion

Enabling people support will allow the user to condition image generation using:

- A person from their system Photos library
- A character represented by an appearance and a skin tone

Personalization options are available through several user interfaces, including:

- A people picker
- Detection of people names in the prompt text field
- Importing images containing people faces from the system photo library

Enabled by default when the modifier is not set or when the policy is set to `automatic`.
