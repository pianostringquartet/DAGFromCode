**Navigation:** [Swiftui](/documentation/swiftui) â€º [view](/documentation/swiftui/view)

**Instance Method**

# scrollDismissesKeyboard(_:)

**Available on:** iOS 16.0+, iPadOS 16.0+, Mac Catalyst 16.0+, macOS 13.0+, tvOS 16.0+, watchOS 9.0+

> Configures the behavior in which scrollable content interacts with the software keyboard.

```swift
nonisolated func scrollDismissesKeyboard(_ mode: ScrollDismissesKeyboardMode) -> some View
```

## Parameters

**mode**

The keyboard dismissal mode that scrollable content uses.



## Return Value

A view that uses the specified keyboard dismissal mode.

## Discussion

You use this modifier to customize how scrollable content interacts with the software keyboard. For example, you can specify a value of [immediately](/documentation/swiftui/scrolldismisseskeyboardmode/immediately) to indicate that you would like scrollable content to immediately dismiss the keyboard if present when a scroll drag gesture begins.

```swift
@State private var text = ""

ScrollView {
    TextField("Prompt", text: $text)
    ForEach(0 ..< 50) { index in
        Text("\(index)")
            .padding()
    }
}
.scrollDismissesKeyboard(.immediately)
```

You can also use this modifier to customize the keyboard dismissal behavior for other kinds of scrollable views, like a [List](/documentation/swiftui/list) or a [Text Editor](/documentation/swiftui/texteditor).

By default, a [Text Editor](/documentation/swiftui/texteditor) is interactive while other kinds of scrollable content always dismiss the keyboard on a scroll when linked against iOS 16 or later. Pass a value of [never](/documentation/swiftui/scrolldismisseskeyboardmode/never) to indicate that scrollable content should never automatically dismiss the keyboard.
