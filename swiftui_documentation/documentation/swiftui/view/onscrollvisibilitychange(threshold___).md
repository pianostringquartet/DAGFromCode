**Instance Method**

# onScrollVisibilityChange(threshold:_:)

**Available on:** iOS 18.0+, iPadOS 18.0+, Mac Catalyst 18.0+, macOS 15.0+, tvOS 18.0+, visionOS 2.0+, watchOS 11.0+

> Adds an action to be called when the view crosses the threshold to be considered on/off screen.

```swift
nonisolated func onScrollVisibilityChange(threshold: Double = 0.5, _ action: @escaping (Bool) -> Void) -> some View
```

## Parameters

**threshold**

The amount required to be visible within the viewport of the parent view before the `action` is fired. By default when the view has crossed more than 50% on-screen, the action will be called.



**action**

The action which will be called when the threshold has been reached.



## Discussion

Use this modifier to be informed when the view has crossed the provided threshold to be considered on/off screen.

```swift
struct VideoPlayer: View {
    @State var playing: Bool

    var body: some View {
        Group {
            // ...
        }
        .onScrollVisibilityChange(threshold: 0.2) { isVisible in
            playing = isVisible
        }
    }
}
```

When the view appears on-screen, the action will be called if the threshold has already been reached.
