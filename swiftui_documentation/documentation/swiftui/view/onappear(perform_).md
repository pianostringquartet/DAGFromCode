**Instance Method**

# onAppear(perform:)

**Available on:** iOS 13.0+, iPadOS 13.0+, Mac Catalyst 13.0+, macOS 10.15+, tvOS 13.0+, visionOS 1.0+, watchOS 6.0+

> Adds an action to perform before this view appears.

```swift
nonisolated func onAppear(perform action: (() -> Void)? = nil) -> some View
```

## Parameters

**action**

The action to perform. If `action` is `nil`, the call has no effect.



## Return Value

A view that triggers `action` before it appears.

## Discussion

The exact moment that SwiftUI calls this method depends on the specific view type that you apply it to, but the `action` closure completes before the first rendered frame appears.
