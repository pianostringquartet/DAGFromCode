**Instance Method**

# fileMover(isPresented:file:onCompletion:)

**Available on:** iOS 14.0+, iPadOS 14.0+, Mac Catalyst 14.0+, macOS 11.0+, visionOS 1.0+

> Presents a system interface for allowing the user to move an existing file to a new location.

```swift
nonisolated func fileMover(isPresented: Binding<Bool>, file: URL?, onCompletion: @escaping (Result<URL, any Error>) -> Void) -> some View
```

## Parameters

**isPresented**

A binding to whether the interface should be shown.



**file**

The `URL` of the file to be moved.



**onCompletion**

A callback that will be invoked when the operation has has succeeded or failed. To access the received URLs, call `startAccessingSecurityScopedResource`. When the access is no longer required, call `stopAccessingSecurityScopedResource`.



## Discussion

> [!NOTE]
> This interface provides security-scoped URLs. Call the `startAccessingSecurityScopedResource` method to access or bookmark the URLs, and the `stopAccessingSecurityScopedResource` method to release the access.

In order for the interface to appear, both `isPresented` must be `true` and `file` must not be `nil`. When the operation is finished, `isPresented` will be set to `false` before `onCompletion` is called. If the user cancels the operation, `isPresented` will be set to `false` and `onCompletion` will not be called.
