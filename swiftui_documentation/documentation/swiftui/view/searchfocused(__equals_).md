**Navigation:** [Swiftui](/documentation/swiftui) â€º [view](/documentation/swiftui/view)

**Instance Method**

# searchFocused(_:equals:)

**Available on:** iOS 18.0+, iPadOS 18.0+, Mac Catalyst 18.0+, macOS 15.0+, visionOS 2.0+

> Modifies this view by binding the focus state of the search field associated with the nearest searchable modifier to the given value.

```swift
nonisolated func searchFocused<V>(_ binding: FocusState<V>.Binding, equals value: V) -> some View where V : Hashable
```

## Parameters

**binding**

The state binding to register. When focus moves to the associated search field, the binding sets the bound value to the corresponding match value. If a caller sets the state value programmatically to the matching value, then focus moves to the search field. When focus leaves the search field, the binding sets the bound value to `nil`. If a caller sets the value to `nil`, SwiftUI automatically dismisses focus.



**value**

The value to match against when determining whether the binding should change.



## Return Value

The modified view.

## Discussion

To control focus by matching a simple boolean condition, use the [searchFocused(_:)](/documentation/swiftui/view/searchfocused(_:)) modifier instead.

For more information about using searchable modifiers, refer to [Adding-a-search-interface-to-your](/documentation/swiftui/adding-a-search-interface-to-your-app).
