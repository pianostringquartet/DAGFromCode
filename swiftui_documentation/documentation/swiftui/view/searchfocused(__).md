nonisolated func searchFocused(_ binding: FocusState<Bool>.Binding) -> some View

## Discussion

To control focus by matching a non-boolean value, use the [searchFocused(_:equals:)](/documentation/swiftui/view/searchfocused(_:equals:)) modifier instead.

For more information about using searchable modifiers, refer to [Adding-a-search-interface-to-your](/documentation/swiftui/adding-a-search-interface-to-your-app).
