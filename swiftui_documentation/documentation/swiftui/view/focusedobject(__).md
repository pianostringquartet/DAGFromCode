**Instance Method**

# focusedObject(_:)

**Available on:** iOS 16.0+, iPadOS 16.0+, Mac Catalyst 16.0+, macOS 13.0+, tvOS 16.0+, visionOS 1.0+, watchOS 9.0+

> Creates a new view that exposes the provided object to other views whose whose state depends on the focused view hierarchy.

```swift
nonisolated func focusedObject<T>(_ object: T) -> some View where T : ObservableObject
```

## Parameters

**object**

The observable object to associate with focus.



## Return Value

A view that supplies an observable object when in focus.

## Discussion

Use this method instead of [focusedSceneObject(_:)](/documentation/swiftui/view/focusedsceneobject(_:)) when your scene includes multiple focusable views with their own associated data, and you need an app- or scene-scoped element like a command or toolbar item that operates on the data associated with whichever view currently has focus. Each focusable view can supply its own object:

```swift
struct MessageView: View {
    @StateObject private var message = Message(...)

    var body: some View {
        TextField(...)
            .focusedObject(message)
    }
}
```

Interested views can then use the [Focused Object](/documentation/swiftui/focusedobject) property wrapper to observe and update the focused viewâ€™s object. In this example, an app command updates the focused viewâ€™s data, and is automatically disabled when focus is in an unrelated part of the scene:

```swift
struct MessageCommands: Commands {
    @FocusedObject private var message: Message?

    var body: some Commands {
        CommandGroup(after: .pasteboard) {
            Button("Add Duck to Message") {
                message?.text.append(" ðŸ¦†")
            }
            .keyboardShortcut("d")
            .disabled(message == nil)
        }
    }
}
```
