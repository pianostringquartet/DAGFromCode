## Discussion

Accessibility default focus is evaluated when a scene appears and an accessibility technology like VoiceOver focuses on its content, when an accessibility focus state binding update moves focus automatically, and when the layout of a scene changes and the accessibility technology must refocus on new content.

In the following example, an accessibility technology, like VoiceOver, automatically lands on the title of the playlist as the most important view to initially have focus on, rather than navigating through all controls to understand what the primary content of the view is.

```swift
var body: some View {
    VStack {
        PlayerControls(currentSong: $currentSong)
        Text(playlist.title)
            .font(.title)
            .accessibilityFocused($focusedField, equals: .title)
        PlaylistEntries(entries: playlist.entries)
    }
    .accessibilityDefaultFocus($focusedField, .title)
}
```
