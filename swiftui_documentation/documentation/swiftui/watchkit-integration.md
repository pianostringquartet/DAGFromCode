# WatchKit integration

> Add WatchKit views to your SwiftUI app, or use SwiftUI views in your WatchKit app.

## Overview

Integrate SwiftUI with your appâ€™s existing content using hosting controllers to add SwiftUI views into WatchKit interfaces. A hosting controller wraps a set of SwiftUI views in a form that you can then add to your storyboard-based app.



You can also add WatchKit views and view controllers to your SwiftUI interfaces. A representable object wraps the designated view or view controller, and facilitates communication between the wrapped object and your SwiftUI views.

For design guidance, see [designing-for](/design/Human-Interface-Guidelines/designing-for-watchos) in the Human Interface Guidelines.

## Displaying SwiftUI views in WatchKit

- [WKHostingController](/documentation/swiftui/wkhostingcontroller) A WatchKit interface controller that hosts a SwiftUI view hierarchy.
- [WKUserNotificationHostingController](/documentation/swiftui/wkusernotificationhostingcontroller) A WatchKit user notification interface controller that hosts a SwiftUI view hierarchy.

## Adding WatchKit views to SwiftUI view hierarchies

- [WKInterfaceObjectRepresentable](/documentation/swiftui/wkinterfaceobjectrepresentable) A view that represents a WatchKit interface object.
- [WKInterfaceObjectRepresentableContext](/documentation/swiftui/wkinterfaceobjectrepresentablecontext) Contextual information about the state of the system that you use to create and update your WatchKit interface object.

## Framework integration

- [AppKit integration](/documentation/swiftui/appkit-integration)
