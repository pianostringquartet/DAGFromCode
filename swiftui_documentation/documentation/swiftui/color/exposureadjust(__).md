> Returns a new color with an exposure adjustment applied.

```swift
func exposureAdjust(_ stops: Double) -> Color
```

## Parameters

**stops**

The number of exposure levels to adjust by.



## Return Value

A new color with the exposure adjustment applied.

## Discussion

This function adjusts the exposure of a color by multipling its linear-light representation by `pow(2, stops)` and adjusting its HDR content headroom.

For example the system yellow color could have its brightness increased by two exposure levels:

```swift
Color.yellow.exposureAdjust(2)
```
