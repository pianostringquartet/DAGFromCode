```swift
struct AlignmentStrategy
```

## Overview

> [!NOTE]
> [Text](/documentation/swiftui/text) tightly wraps its content, so text alignment only affects how lines are positioned relative to each other. The text as a whole needs to be positioned at the view level using [Alignment](/documentation/swiftui/alignment).
