## Discussion

> [!NOTE]
> The `+` on `Text` has been deprecated.
> 
> Using this operator to concatenate texts hardcodes a specific order for part of the sentence. This may lead to incorrect localization, especially for right-to-left languages.
> 
> Instead, prefer using the initializer on `Text` that allows for string interpolation. For example, instead of `Text("Hello") + Text(name)`, that concatenation can be equivalently expressed as `Text("Hello, \(name)!")`.
> 
> See [Text](/documentation/swiftui/text) for more information on localization and string interpolation.
