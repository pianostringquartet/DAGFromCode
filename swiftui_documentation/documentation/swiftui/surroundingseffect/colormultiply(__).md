**Type Method**

# colorMultiply(_:)

**Available on:** macOS 26.0+, visionOS 2.0+

> An effect that applies a custom tint to the passthrough video by multiplying the passthrough with a .

```swift
static func colorMultiply(_ color: Color) -> SurroundingsEffect
```

## Parameters

**color**

The color to bias the passthrough toward. The opacity of the color is ignored. Use the extended color space to brighten the passthrough.



## Discussion

Use this with the [preferredSurroundingsEffect(_:)](/documentation/swiftui/view/preferredsurroundingseffect(_:)) view modifier when you want to tint the passthrough while displaying a particular view. The system may decide to limit how much each color in the passthrough can be brightened or darkened. `Color.black` will cause no passthrough to be visible, and `Color.white` will have no effect. `Color(red: 1.15, green: 1.0, blue: 1.0)` would brighten the red in the passthrough by 15 percent. This effect will only be applied while an immersive space is opened.
