## Discussion

Use this with the [preferredSurroundingsEffect(_:)](/documentation/swiftui/view/preferredsurroundingseffect(_:)) view modifier when you want to darken the passthrough while displaying a particular view. The value will be clamped between 0 and 1. This effect will only be applied while an immersive space is opened.
