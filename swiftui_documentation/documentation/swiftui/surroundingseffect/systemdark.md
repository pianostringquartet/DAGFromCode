## Discussion

Use this value with the [preferredSurroundingsEffect(_:)](/documentation/swiftui/view/preferredsurroundingseffect(_:)) view modifier when you want to dim passthrough video while displaying a particular view. Doing so helps to draw attention to your app’s content while still enabling people to remain aware of their surroundings.
