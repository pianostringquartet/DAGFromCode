## Discussion

In macOS and in Mac Catalyst apps, the system places items in the current toolbar section in order of leading to trailing. On watchOS, only the first item appears, pinned beneath the navigation bar.

In iPadOS, the system places items in the center of the navigation bar if the navigation bar supports customization. Otherwise, it places items in the trailing position of the navigation bar.

In iOS, and tvOS, the system places items in the trailing position of the navigation bar.

In iOS, iPadOS, and macOS, the system uses the space available to the toolbar when determining how many items to render in the toolbar. If not all items fit in the available space, an overflow menu may be created and remaining items placed in that menu.
